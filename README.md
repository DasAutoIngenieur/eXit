# PRESS ANY KEY TO START.

eXit is the game found on the Mr Robot tv series. It can be played here: https://www.whoismrrobot.com/exit/

I have ported the game over to Python as part of a project I created to understand and learn Python.

# Requirements
* os
* sys

# Usage

```
python3 eXit.py
```

# Disclaimer:
This is my first Python program created, it may not have been written using the best Python coding skills but it has been done 100% by me. Feel free to suggest changes/improves/feedback via the Issues section. Thank you.

This piece of software has no affiliation with the Mr Robot brand or the USA Network.
